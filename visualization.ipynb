    "# Encoding Techniques Applied in the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preprocessing of the Amazon product dataset, we applied categorical encoding to transform text-based category columns into numerical formats. This step is essential for enabling machine learning models, correlation analysis, and efficient data processing while maintaining the dataset's usability for visualization and exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Label Encoding (Primary Method Used)\n",
    "\n",
    "We applied **Label Encoding** (using `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder`) to the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `main_category` (extracted from the first part of the `category` hierarchy) → encoded as `main_category_encoded`\n",
    "- `category` (the full hierarchical category path) → encoded as `category_encoded`\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**  \n",
    "Each unique category value is assigned a unique integer (e.g., \"Computers&Accessories\" → 1, \"Home&Kitchen\" → 3, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Goal:**\n",
    "- Handle high-cardinality categorical features efficiently (the full `category` column has 211 unique values).\n",
    "- Provide a compact numerical representation suitable for tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) and other algorithms that do not assume ordinal relationships between categories.\n",
    "- Minimize memory usage and avoid excessive feature expansion, making the dataset more scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. One-Hot Encoding (Not Applied)\n",
    "\n",
    "We deliberately chose **not** to use One-Hot Encoding in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason:**  \n",
    "The categorical columns have moderate to high cardinality (9 main categories and 211 full subcategories). One-Hot Encoding would create hundreds of new binary columns, leading to:\n",
    "- Significant increase in dataset dimensionality.\n",
    "- Higher memory consumption.\n",
    "- Risk of the \"curse of dimensionality\" in downstream modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chosen Alternative:**  \n",
    "Label Encoding offers the best trade-off for this dataset, especially given the focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and preparation for models that perform well with label-encoded categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Preservation & Result\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safe Copy:** All encoding operations were performed on a separate dataframe named `df_encoded`. This ensures the original `df` remains untouched and fully human-readable for reporting, charting, and interpretation.\n",
    "- **Shape Comparison:**\n",
    "  - Original `df`: (1465 rows, original columns)\n",
    "  - `df_encoded`: Same number of rows, with **only +2 additional columns** (`main_category_encoded` and `category_encoded`)\n",
    "  - **Result:** Efficient numerical"
